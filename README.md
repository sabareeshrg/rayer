A Simple Renderman Renderer. Only part of the shading language and a simple polygon renderer is implemented. I wrote it in 2004, maybe don't have time to improve it. If it is useful for anyone, feel free to use it. The bin folder uses resources from The Renderman Companion, all rights belong to that book.
